    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">31. By accessing the Website and investing in any deal on the Website, you acknowledge that you understand and accept the risks involved in any investment and that Wellkins Capital has disclosed and provided the following risk warnings:</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(a) Investing in early stage securities is a high risk strategy which means you can potentially lose all the money you invest;</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(b) Most investors in this asset class try to diversify their allocation across many companies in order to mitigate or reduce risk;</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(c) Wellkins Capital makes no representation about, nor gives any guarantee of, future performance, future profitability, payment of dividends or return of capital in respect of any company listed on Wellkins Capital.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(d) Wellkins Capital&rsquo;s initial screening of companies applying for funding on the Wellkins Capital platform is limited to verifying that the founders are who they say they are and that the company is eligible for Wellkins Capital funding. This screening is not a recommendation to invest and should not be mistaken for due diligence.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(e) Wellkins Capital recommends that you assess your appetite for risk independently and consult with your tax, legal and/or financial planning advisors before making a decision to invest through Wellkins Capital.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">32. Some of the risks involved included, but are not limited to, the following categories:</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(a) General economic conditions: General economic conditions (including interest rates, exchange rates and underlying inflation in Australia and internationally) may affect the performance of an investment. These may impact on financing costs (both in respect of the operation of companies and to potential purchasers of the companies) and the state of the market for stock exchange floats or trade sales. Downturns in economies usually have a negative effect on the earnings of companies and the availability of suitably valued exits.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(b) Regulatory changes: Regulatory changes have a significant influence on the outlook for companies and the returns to investors. Prospective investors should be aware that the consequences of regulatory change or additional regulation on the Wellkins Capital investment structure or equity based crowd funding generally may have adverse consequences for investments made through Wellkins Capital.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(c) Tax changes: Changes to legislation or subsequent decisions of the Australian Taxation Office may impair the tax status of the Wellkins Capital investment structure, the net proceeds of sale of investments or the availability of capital gains tax concessions.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(d) Concentration and diversification: A large proportion of startups fail. A large percentage of the returns in a diversified portfolio of startups is often generated by a small percentage of those startups. Investments through Wellkins Capital should only be made as part of a diversified portfolio. Wellkins Capital generally recommends you assign the investment funds you wish to allocate to early stage securities across a diversified selection of companies, rather than invest it all in one or two companies. Any funds you invest in early stage securities should represent a small proportion of your total investable capital.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(e) No assurance of investment return: Investing in early stage securities may result in the loss or some or all of your investment capital. No assurance of investment return is given to investors. The return on investment will depend on the success of the specific investments you select, which cannot accurately be forecast. Returns to investors, if any, should not be expected in the short term or at regular intervals.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(f) Speculative investment: Investment in early stage securities through Wellkins Capital should be regarded as speculative, involves a high level of risk and may be subject to a number of conflicts of interest. Investments should be considered only by sophisticated or professional investors able to sustain a loss of all or part of the sum invested and who do not require certain or predictable income flows or liquidity in their investments.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(g) Conflicts of interest: A shareholder in Wellkins Capital, and its affiliates may manage other funds that may buy or sell similar investments as those listed on Wellkins Capital. In managing the investments of these funds, conflicts of interest may arise. There is nothing to prohibit affiliates from engaging in any other existing or future business, andmay provide investment management services to other clients. Therefore, the terms relating to the relationship between those parties were not negotiated at arm&rsquo;s length. In the event that a conflict of interest arises, Wellkins Capital will attempt to minimise or resolve such conflict, to the extent feasible, in a fair and equitable manner.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(h) Most favoured deal terms: Where a fundraising campaign is typically lead by an external investor(s), Wellkins Capital investors invest on the basis of a &lsquo;most favoured terms&rsquo; clause. This means our investors have the benefit of the most favourable terms the company negotiates with the lead external investor(s). In this situation, Wellkins Capital does not negotiate those terms on your behalf. If there is no lead external investor, the Wellkins Capital team will negotiate the deal terms directly with the company without consultation or the requirement for the approval of the investors.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(i) Investments in early stage business: Early stage companies may not have consistent sales or income. They may also have difficulty attracting management and employees with the right mix of skills and expertise, especially at the various stages in their life cycles when different abilities are required. These companies may have a high risk of business failure. It is likely that a proportion of these investments will fail and that some of your investments will experience losses.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(j) Lack of management control: Investors have no right to control the operations of the Wellkins Capital trust through which you invest in an underlying company nor to control the underlying company itself. Investors must rely on Wellkins Capital to manage the affairs of the relevant trust. Wellkins Capital has wide latitude in making decisions in respect of the investments made.</span></span></p>
    
    <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif">(k) Long term investment: Due to the early stage status of the startups listed on Wellkins Capital investors must be prepared to have a long term investment horizon.</span></span></p></div>
